I used the lecture as a resource for this assignment.

## Comments
This was an informative assignment.  Unfortunately I don't quite know how to provide links to my project in the W3C validator or the outliner.  I am sorry for the late submission as I spent all my time for two weeks creating an application and portfolio for a creative job at my workplace.
